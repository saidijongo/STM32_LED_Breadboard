Prescaler: The TIM2 clock is divided by (Prescaler + 1).
Prescaler = 999 means the clock is divided by 1000.

Period: The timer counts from 0 to (Period - 1).
Period = 7199 means the timer counts up to 7199.

Frequency: For a clock frequency of 72 MHz:
Timer frequency = Clock frequency / (Prescaler + 1) = 72,000,000 / 1000 = 72,000 Hz.
Timer period = (Period + 1) / Timer frequency = 7200 / 72,000 = 0.1 seconds (100 ms).

This means the timer interrupt will occur every 100 ms, toggling the LEDs at a rate of 10 Hz.
